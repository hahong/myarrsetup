IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
29:fe:2a:22:ca:36:c8:ac:35:8b:23:11:96:1b:3d:a8.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /home/array/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending RSA key in /home/array/.ssh/known_hosts:3
  remove with: ssh-keygen -f "/home/array/.ssh/known_hosts" -R dicarlo16
RSA host key for dicarlo16 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
